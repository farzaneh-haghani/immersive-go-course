     The options are as follows:

     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display a
             dollar sign (‘$’) at the end of each line.

     -l      Set an exclusive advisory lock on the standard output file
             descriptor.  This lock is set using fcntl(2) with the F_SETLKW
             command.  If the output file is already locked, cat will block
             until the lock is acquired.
